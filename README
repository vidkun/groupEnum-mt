This is a multithreaded tool to fully enumerate the membership of any Windows 
group, providing a list of user accounts only. This tool is able to move between 
local and domain groups, and can even move between multiple domains so long as 
you have permission to read group membership.

Requires PowerShell 3.0

MULTITHREADED USAGE:

Currently, this tool must be called via the Start-MultiThread.ps1 launcher. If
anyone has suggestions for getting the jobs handlers merged into the single
script, I am certainly open to pull requests.

Drop Start-MultiThread.ps1, groupEnum-mt.ps1, and hosts.txt (optional) into
the same directory. Edit Start-MultiThread.ps1 to change $machines to list
the desired target machines to enumerate. Otherwise, comment out the current
line and uncomment the other line to have it read from a list of machines
at .\hosts.txt.

Options:

None currently.


SINGLE-THREAD USAGE:

This tool can be used single-threaded by simply running the groupEnum-mt.ps1
script directly instead of calling it via Start-MultiThread.ps1. 


Options:

    -h <hostname>	            Host name of the machine you want to
				    enumerate groups on, default: localhost

    -d <domain name>                specify the domain of the group you which
                                    to enumerate membership of, default: local
                                    
    -g <group name>                 The name of the group you wish to enumerate,
				    default: Administrators
    
    -verbose                        Provides verbose output, printing groups
                                    and users as they are found
                                    
    -printName {true|false}         prints each users username, default: true
    
    -printSID {true|false}          prints each user's SID, default: true
    
    -printGroup {true|false}        prints the group from which users inherit
                                    membership, default: true
                                    
    -printDisabled {true|false}     appends "[DISABLED]" to the user if their
                                    account is disabled, default: true
                                    
    -printPasswordAge {true|false}  prints the each user's password age in
                                    days, default: true
								
    -c <csv file>		    The name of the destination csv file
				    to write results to, default: .\$date.admins.csv
                                    
Examples:

    .\groupEnum.ps1 -g "Administrators"
        Prints the name of each user inheriting membership from local admins
    
    .\groupEnum.ps1 -g "Domain Admins" -d "foo.bar" -printSID true
        Prints the name and SID of each Domain Admin of the foo.bar domain
    
    .\groupEnum.ps1 -g "Domain Admins" -d "foo.bar" -printPasswordAge true
        Prints the name and password age of each Domain Admin in foo.bar


Known Issues/Planned Changes:

* It appears that groupEnum-mt may not be fully enumerating the group for some
  reason. My test group has two machines where one is missing a local user account
  from the results and the second is missing that same local user account and an
  entire AD group from the results.

* Running multithreaded is causing issues with writing the output to CSV. Results
  are either not get written to file due to multiple threads accessing the file at
  once, results are being written all jacked up on some lines, or writing fails 
  due to file lock errors. Trying to move toward having the results all kicked back
  to Start-MultiThread.ps1 and written out in single dump from there.

* Planned: Combine both scripts into a single script

* Planned: Add functionality to verify machine is alive before attempting to enumerate
 
* Planned: Add option to query AD for list of computers to enumerate
